# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Kimal Honour Djam brings a unique scientific perspective to the world of personal development through his groundbreaking work on strategic detachment. With his background as a Consulting Radiation Oncology Physicist and extensive training in data science, Honour applies the same analytical precision and evidence-based approach from his medical career to the psychology of attention management and mental freedom.

His journey to developing "The Unbothered Code" began during his time as Chief Resident at Henry Ford Health, where he observed how high-performing medical professionals struggled with digital overwhelm and attention fragmentation despite their technical expertise. This observation led him to research the neuroscience of focus and develop practical frameworks for reclaiming mental clarity in high-pressure environments.

As a Medical Nuclear Science Officer with the US Army National Guard/Reserves, Honour has mastered the discipline of maintaining focus amid chaos—a skill he translates into actionable strategies for readers. His work at the intersection of neuroscience and decision-making draws from both his scientific training (PhD(c) in Medical Physics, MS degrees, and MIT certification in Applied Data Science) and his real-world experience leading teams across multiple healthcare facilities.

Through his companies Djam Academy and AlienNova, Honour has helped thousands implement systematic approaches to information management and strategic detachment, proving that caring less about digital noise directly correlates with increased performance and well-being. His teaching experience as a college physics professor has honed his ability to make complex concepts accessible and practical for everyday application.

"Why Caring Less Makes You Unstoppable" represents the culmination of Honour's research into how our neurological responses to digital stimuli affect our decision-making capacity and overall effectiveness—and more importantly, how we can reclaim control through strategic detachment.
