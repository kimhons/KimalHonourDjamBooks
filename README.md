## Chapter Versioning

Each chapter in the manuscript can have multiple versions to track its evolution:

- **Current Version**: The latest approved version of each chapter is stored directly in the `chapters/` directory (e.g., `01_chapter_1.md`)
- **Historical Versions**: Previous iterations are stored in the `chapters/versions/` directory, organized by chapter and version number
- **Naming Convention**: Version files follow the pattern `vX_description.md` where X is the version number and description indicates the version status (e.g., draft, revised, final)

This versioning system allows for tracking the evolution of each chapter while maintaining a clean directory structure for the current manuscript.
