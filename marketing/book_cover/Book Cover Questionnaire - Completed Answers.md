Based on the cover mockups already created and the book's content:

1. **Symbolic imagery** that represents freedom from digital distraction and mental clutter (broken chains, shield, phoenix)
2. **Abstract representation** of a calm figure amid chaos (as shown in some mockups)
3. **Modern professional environment** references that resonate with the target audience
4. **Bold typography** emphasizing "CARING LESS" as the key concept
5. **Color scheme** using dark backgrounds with vibrant orange/teal/gold accents for visual impact

The book's central concept of "strategic detachment" should be visually represented through imagery that shows breaking free from constraints while maintaining focus and purpose.
